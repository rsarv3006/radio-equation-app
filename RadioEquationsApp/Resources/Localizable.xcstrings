    "The antenna gain equation calculates the gain of an antenna in decibels (dB). The gain represents how much an antenna concentrates radio frequency energy in a particular direction, if the antenna is a non-omnidirectional antenna.  If it is an omni-directional antenna, then the gain or main-lobe of the radio frequency energy is assumed to radiate in a 360-degree pattern, as in a sphere-shaped pattern.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n[math]$antenna gain (in db)[/math]\n\n\n[math]= 10 \\times log_1_0(P2 / P1)$[/math]\n\nWhere:\n\nOutput power is the power radiated by the antenna in the direction of peak radiation intensity. This is measured in watts (W).\nInput power is the power supplied to the antenna at its input terminals. This is also measured in watts.\nlog10 is the base-10 logarithm function.\n10 is a constant factor to convert the logarithmic value to decibels.\nThe ratio of output power to input power gives the power gain of the antenna. Taking the logarithm of this ratio gives the gain in absolute units. Multiplying by 10 converts this to decibels, which is the standard unit used to express antenna gain.\n\nSo in summary, this formula takes the ratio of output to input power, takes the logarithm to get the absolute gain, and then converts to decibels to calculate the total antenna gain. The higher the gain in dB, the more intense the antenna radiation is in a particular direction (if a non-omnidirectional antenna) or not (if an omnidirectional antenna.)" : {

It refers to the amount of energy transferred or used by an electrical circuit or device.\nR represents resistance and is measured in ohms (Ω). Resistance is a property of a circuit element, such as a resistor or a wire, that opposes the flow of electric current.\nThe equation [math]$P = E^2 / R$[/math] expresses the relationship between these variables. It states that the power (P) in a circuit is equal to the square of the electrical energy (E) divided by the resistance (R) encountered by the current.\n\nThis equation can be derived by combining Ohm's Law [math]$(I = V / R)$[/math] with the power formula [math]$(P = V \\times I)$[/math]. Since voltage (V) can be expressed as [math]$V = E / Q$[/math] (where Q is the charge), and current (I) can be expressed as [math]$I = Q / t$[/math] (where t is time), we can substitute these expressions into the power formula and rearrange to obtain [math]$P = E^2 / R$[/math].\n\nIn practical terms, this equation is commonly used to calculate the power dissipation in a circuit when the electrical energy and resistance values are known. It shows that power is inversely proportional to the resistance and that doubling the resistance will halve the power dissipation. Similarly, increasing the electrical energy will result in higher power, assuming the resistance remains constant." : {

Power refers to the rate at which energy is transferred, used, or consumed in a circuit or device.\nI stands for current and is measured in amperes (A). Current refers to the flow of electric charge in a circuit, specifically the rate at which charges move through a conductor.\nR represents resistance and is measured in ohms (Ω). Resistance is a property of a circuit element, such as a resistor or a wire, that opposes the flow of electric current.\nThe equation [math]$P = I^2 \\times R$[/math] expresses the relationship between these variables. It states that the power (P) in a circuit is equal to the square of the current (I) multiplied by the resistance (R) encountered by the current.\n\nThis equation is derived from Ohm's Law, which states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to the resistance. By substituting the expression for current from Ohm's Law [math]$(I = V / R)$[/math] into the equation [math]$P = I^2 \\times R$[/math], we can derive the power formula.\n\nIn practical terms, this equation is commonly used to calculate the power dissipation in a circuit when the current and resistance values are known. It illustrates that power is directly proportional to the square of the current and the resistance. Therefore, a circuit with higher current or higher resistance will dissipate more power. Conversely, decreasing either the current or resistance will result in lower power dissipation." : {

    "The equation [math]$Z = E / I$[/math] represents the relationship between impedance (Z), electrical energy (E), and current (I) in an electrical circuit.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each component:\n\nZ represents impedance and is measured in ohms (Ω). Impedance is a property of a circuit element, such as a resistor or a wire, that opposes the flow of electric current.\nE represents electrical energy and is measured in joules (J) or sometimes in electron volts (eV). It refers to the amount of energy transferred or used by an electrical circuit or device.\nI stands for current and is measured in amperes (A). Current refers to the flow of electric charge in a circuit, specifically the rate at which charges move through a conductor.\nThe equation [math]$Z = E / I$[/math] expresses the relationship between these variables. It states that the impedance (Z) in a circuit is equal to the product of the electrical energy (E) and the current (I) flowing through the circuit.\n\nIn practical terms, this equation is commonly used to calculate the impedance in a circuit when the energy and current values are known. It can also be rearranged to solve for other variables. For example, if you know the impedance and current, you can calculate the energy by rearranging the equation as [math]$E = Z * I$[/math].\n\nE is electrical voltage potential in volts. \n\nI is the flow of electrons in amperes.
